### Hi there 👋, I'm Paul Boyce. I'm a full stack react JS developer and tech founder. <br>
 
:seedling: **Currently working through these:**  Articles that teach students and developers new-to-them technologies. <br>
Here are some examples of what I have been mugging up on: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [AI: Machine Learning with Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-with-javascript/)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [GraphQL with React](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-with-react-course/)<br>

:nerd_face: **Favorite Courses:**  These are my favorite online courses I've used to keep my skills sharp and refer back to for ongoing projects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Startup Engineering (*That famous Stanford Course on Coursera back in 2013!!*)] [Watch VIDEO on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byAEadZz5Wk) [Get PDF Course Materials on Nadezhda Ryabtsova's Github](https://github.com/ladamalina/coursera-startup) This is how we got our new team all lined up on a single page, back in 2013. Listen at 1.5 or 2x speed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [React: Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) Stephen Grider manages to write production quality code in most of his teaching<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [React Native - The Practical Guide ](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/
) Max gives half this course free on YouTube. I think that is pretty generous.<br>

:books: **Recently Published:** Articles about tech work to remind me the paths I have walked <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Migrate Web App from Backbone to ReactJS](https://medium.com/@paulmboyce/how-to-migrate-from-backbone-to-react-using-nodejs-expressjs-ejs-and-webpack-c0524b466713)<br>

🌱 *Currently Learning*: React-Native and Ruby<br>
🤔 *Looking for help*: I'm looking for help with trying to find my first software engineering job in this current job climate.<br>
